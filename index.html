                <h2>Story</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>I'm 18 y.o. and I passionate about programming since childhood. Seriously, I wanted to become a
                    programmer since about 7 yo.</p>
                <p>I started learning to code at 11 years.
                    My first language was Pascal. Then I learned the basics of HTML. I made a few programmes in Delphi
                    just
                    for myself. Had a small experience with C++.</p>
                <p>Next, I got interested in web programming and started learning HTML5, CSS3, and PHP. Made simple web
                    app
                    for myself. It just gave me a code number for its id. Then improved it, so it was done through the
                    database.</p>
                <p>Then I started learning Python. I liked this language for nice and simple syntax. Rewrote codes app
                    in
                    Django with small jQuery inserts. It was almost a year ago, so the code is pretty old. There are
                    even
                    database credentials in VCS. Now I never commit auth data and use env files instead.</p>
                <p>Also at this time, I completed Russian and English typing courses on <a
                        href="https://klava.org/delta/"
                        title="Awesome web app">klava.org</a>.
                    BTW, it's an
                    amazing app for learning touch typing.</p>
                <p>I made a few small apps with Python/requests/Django, VK API. Built <a
                        href="https://reposter.tmweb.ru">Reposter</a>.
                    It's a much more
                    recent freelance project for automation reposts in many groups in VK. <a
                            href="https://reposter.tmweb.ru">Register</a> and
                    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/dimadk02/reposter/">look at sources on BitBucket</a>. It
                    was
                    difficult to deploy it on VPS, but I did it and got a great experience.</p>
                <p>Also, I made <a href="https://bitbucket.org/dimadk02/suggests-manager/" title="Sources">an app</a> for
                    managing
                    proposed posts of VK groups.
                    Now it is a bit old but made using flexbox and CSS-grid. Have a look at <a
                            href="https://bitbucket.org/dimadk02/suggests-manager/src/master/style.css">CSS.</a></p>
                <p>Then I started learning JS in deep. Learned ES6. Promises were much better than a callback hell with
                    jQuery, which was in my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/dimadk02/suggests-manager/">old project</a>
                    described
                    above.</p>
                <p>Made <a href="https://bitbucket.org/dimadk02/leadstats/">another web app</a> on more modern JS,
                    without
                    any framework,
                    but with webpack. But for now, it's a bit old as well: there are just many functions in a file,
                    which is
                    a thousand lines long, what lead to spaghetti code.</p>
                <p>At this summer I take the course at ITranstion. The best part of it was Clean Code. It was an amazing
                    experience. I read an entire book by Robert C. Martin in English. The most useful parts of it for me
                    was:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Naming</li>
                    <li>Small functions</li>
                    <li>Single Responsibility Principle</li>
                    <li>and for sure TDD</li>
                </ul>
                <p>TDD is amazing. I partly used it in recent projects and it is amazing. It gives the confidence to
                    refactoring.</p>
                <p>The most recent my project is <a href="https://vk.com/app6696593_414574923">calculator of car
                    service</a>.
                    It's <a href="https://vk.com/vkappsdev">VK App</a>. It is ReactJS web app integrated into VK. I made
                    the
                    only frontend. It was a cool experience with React. Have a look at <a
                            href="https://vk.com/app6696593_414574923">app</a>
                    and at <a href="https://github.com/dimadk02/ticalc">sources</a>. Keep in mind, that it needs backend
                    API, which is available only in production, so all API requests will fail in a dev environment.</p>
                <p>Also for all my recent projects, I use <a href="https://sentry.io">Sentry</a> for catching errors.
                </p>
                <p>I love web development and want to make great web apps with JavaScript.</p>

                <p>I was on English courses in <a href="https://www.ih.by/">IH</a> for 4-5 years. I ended up with an
                    Intermediate certificate in 2014. I easily read English documentation and the best Q&A site: <a
                            href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>
                    without translation. Also, I read posts about programming on medium.com without efforts.</p>
                <p>Just because English content is the best.</p>
                <p>Also, I chat in English (through text and voice) with guys from Poland, Egypt, Indonesian, UK, and
                    the
                    USA.
                    I can speak about not difficult topics and understand others person speech.</p>
                <p>Now I'm Pre-Intermediate â€” Intermediate level in English.</p>
